Sure, I can rewrite this README file to make it more detailed and explanatory:

# Infrastructure Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up your infrastructure using Terraform. We utilize make commands to simplify the usage of Terraform for different environments: development, staging, and production. 

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed Terraform and Make on your local machine. 

## Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up your infrastructure:

### Step 1: Initialize the Terraform directory

Before you can use Terraform for creating and updating resources, initialize your working directory which contains the Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one.

Replace `<add your env>` with your desired environment (`dev`, `staging`, or `production`).

```shell
make tf/init ENV=<add your env>
```

### Step 2: Generate and Show an Execution Plan

The `terraform plan` command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files. This command will not modify the infrastructure but only output the actions that will be made.

```shell
make tf/plan ENV=<add your env>
```

### Step 3: Build or Change Infrastructure

The `terraform apply` command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a `terraform plan` execution plan.

```shell
make tf/apply ENV=<add your env>
```

### Step 4: Destroy Infrastructure

The `terraform destroy` command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure. Be careful with this command: it will remove all components associated with the specified environment.

```shell
make tf/destroy ENV=<add your env>
```

That's it! Now you can manage your infrastructure using these commands in different environments. 

Note: Always ensure to replace `<add your env>` with your actual environment name in each command.
